# Read and Write Goroutine
This project will show you how file read and write operation can be done asynchronous. The concurrent task can be archive by using `goroutine` and `channel`. let dive in! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

---
## Prerequisite
- [Golang v1.16 or later](https://go.dev/)

## Get Started
### Run With Golang
1. you will need to install the dependencies that used in this package by running below command
```bash
go mod tidy
```
2. to run the app you will need to run it by running below command
```bash
go run main.go
```
The default digit lenght is 2048 if you want to specific the lenght use
```bash
go run main.go 30
```
3. to run test, simply run
```bash
go test ./...
```
or with coverage
```bash
go test -cover ./...
```
this will run the test in current directory and it's subdirectory
### Run With Docker
ðŸ“Œ This option you will need to install Docker in your machine first ðŸ“Œ
1. you will need to build the docker image, before you can run it
```bash
docker build -t read-digit .
```
2. you can run the image with
```bash
docker run --rm read-digit
```
or with digits count option
```bash
docker run --rm -e DIGITS_COUNT=30 read-digit
```
## Build The Binary
1. to build the app to binary file you can simply use below command
```bash
go build -o read-digit .
```
1. to run binary file
```bash
./read-digit
```
The default digit lenght is 2048 if you want to specific the lenght use
```bash
./read-digit 30
```
